This project was a collaboration between me and another student.

The project consists of an app that uses speech to text to add words to a database.
The app displays the words in the database using dynamic fragment managmenet where one
fragment manages a recyclerview of the known words and a second fragment hosts the controls.
Each word can have up to 8 unique colors which are translated into a custom lightshow managed
by a second app connected to the same database. The "hardware" app interfaces with an Atmega328P
that manages the low-level control of the LED driver chip.

## ECE 558 Final Project -- Propose, design, implement, and demonstrate a project of your choosing
## <b>This assignment is worth 100 points.  Demo day is  on Thu, 06-Dec from 8:00 AM - 10:30 in FAB 60-19.  Deliverables are due to GitHub on Fri, 07-Dec by 10:00 PM. NO LATE SUBMISSIONS, PLEASE </b>

### <i> We will be using GitHub classroom for this assignment.  You should submit your assignment before the deadline by pushing your final Android Studio projects and other deliverables to your team's shared GitHub repository for the assignment.</i>

## After completing this assignment students should have:
- Proposed and executed a team-based final project involving the Android platform
- Completed a technical presentation and demonstration of the project
- Gained experience in participating in team-based project development and management for a "significant" project


### Summary

Then final project is a chance to put what you learned this term into practice.  Each team will propose a final project which must be accepted by the instructor.  Once the project has been accepted the team will complete the design of the project, implement and debug it, and show it off to their classmates, the instructor and T/A and, perhaps, a few invited guests.  Your team project will be in a friendly competition with the other project teams, with the oft-coveted "Wall of Fame" award going to the best overall project (design, documentation, presentation, etc.).  There is no cash award to the Wall of Fame winners, no bling, no s.w.a.g. ["stuff we all get" according to the Urban Dictionary (https://www.urbandictionary.com)].  So why bother...bragging rights!  Impress your friends!  Impress your classmates!  Impress the hiring managers!

We will be using the Group Project support in GitHub classroom for this assignment.  This means that your team will share a private repository on GitHub that can also be accessed by the instructor and T/A for the course. You will submit your work via that repository.  We will review your work and provide feedback based on what your final submission was.  The process for accepting this assignment is the same as that used for project #3.  This time, though, most of the teams should exist in GitHub classroom since you kept your Project #3 teams. Team members should join the same team.  If you are in a new team one of the team members should create a new group and tell his/her partners what group to join.  As with Project #3 please join only your team;  joining another team either accidentally or deliberately could prevent the actual team member(s) to join.

### (NEW) Where to submit your deliverables for the project:
- Project Proposal:  Submit to your Final Project Proposal dropbox on D2L.  Include a .pdf of your approved proposal in your deliverables
- Progress Report:  Submit your Progress Report to your Final Project Progress Report dropbox on D2L.  Include a .pdf of the progress report in your deliverables
- Demo presentation slides - Include  a .pdf of your final project presentation in your GitHub submission.
- Design Report:  Include a .pdf of your final project design report in your GitHub submission
- Source code, etc.: Include your Android Studio project(s) and any other source code, transcripts, etc. in your GitHub submission
- (optional) Video(s) of your demo.  When I changed the location of Demo Day to FAB 60-19 we lost the ability to easily record the demo presentations.  While certainly not required, you are encouraged to have a friend or classmate record your demo presentation. You are welcome to include any videos you feel will aid in grading your project in your GitHub repository
- Final GitHub repository - to GitHub...obviously, but I'd also like you to upload a .zip file of your repository to your Final Project Deliverables dropbox on D2L.  Some of you will  not be able to do so because D2L places a size limit on uploads.  Still,  I'd appreciate it if you could give it a try.  It's not a big deal either way, but it just might make our grading more efficient.
